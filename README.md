Creating a text editor following this tutorial: https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html

First few steps I was following along 100%, then I started testing things out before the tutorial tells me to do stuff.
I think it is a pretty good way to learn. And going sometimes back to the "basics" is very nice.
Basics as in: programming with few tools, no frameworks.
